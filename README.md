# Description

Welcome to our second class assignment.  In this assignment you will be building the components
of a neural network like architecture by hand and from scratch, using basic numpy vectorized
operations.   You will build a logistic regression classifier to recognize  cats. This assignment
will step you through how to do this with a Neural Network mindset, and so will also hone your intuitions about deep learning.

**Instructions:**

- Do not use loops (for/while) in your code, unless the instructions explicitly ask you to do so.

# Objectives

**You will learn to:**

- Build the general architecture of a learning algorithm, including:
    - Initializing parameters
    - Calculating the cost function and its gradient
    - Using an optimization algorithm (gradient descent) 
- Gather all  functions above to train a set of trainable parameters.
- Use the trained model to make predictions and evaluate its performance.
